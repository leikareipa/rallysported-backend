# RLOAD (RallySportED)
RLOAD is a module of RallySportED that enables the playing of custom tracks in Rally-Sport.

For more information on usage and so on, see the readme file included with RallySportED' binary distribution, available from [Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft's website](http://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/soft).

### Building
To assemble RLOAD for DOS, which is its only target, do ```fasm src/main.asm rsed_ld.exe```, replacing forward slashes with backward ones, if need be. (I use the Windows version of fasm through Wine in Linux, but other permutations are likely to work.)
