# RTEX (RallySportED)
RTEX is a module of RallySportED with which you can edit Rally-Sport's track textures. It's a DOS-based alternative for the texture-editing capability in the non-DOS RGEO module that the DOS-version of RGEO lacks.

For more information on usage and so on, see the readme file included with RallySportED' binary distribution, available from [Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft's website](http://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/soft).

### Building
To assemble RTEX for DOS, which is its only target, do ```fasm src/main.asm rsed_tex.exe```, replacing forward slashes with backward ones, if need be. (I use the Windows version of fasm through Wine in Linux, but other permutations are likely to work.)
