# RAI (RallySportED)
RAI is a module of RallySportED that allows for the editing of Rally-Sport's AI opponents.

For further information and usage instructions, see the readme file included with RallySportED' binary distribution, available from [Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft's website](http://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/soft).

### Building
To assemble RAI for DOS, which is its only target, do ```fasm src/main.asm rsed_ai.exe```, replacing forward slashes with backward ones, if need be. (I use the Windows version of fasm through Wine in Linux, but other permutations are likely to work.)
